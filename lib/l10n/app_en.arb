    "sadrzajOFrankopanima":"From Dujm to Fran Krst, from Krk to Vienna's New Town, from 1118 to 1671... For more than five and a half centuries, Croatian history has been unthinkable without Frankopan. There is no such important social and political duty and role that they have not held; they were princes, bans, sub-kings and warriors, art supporters and poets, and finally political warriors in search of a better world. Behind them remained codes, statutes and other important courtesy documents, recorded in Croatian in a verb letter. A series of 114 Frankopans in 17 generations is recorded in their lineage. Here is only a fraction of their story, to continue on the Paths of Frankopan and visit us at the castle of Nova Kraljevica. \n\nDujam I. ( about 1118.−1163.). Everything started from him. He knows the secret of how the chief from the castle of Gradec - Rozlovnik near Vrbnik became the founder of one of the oldest and most powerful Croatian noble families. In his not too long life, he expressed the qualities of a skilled soldier, a manager, but also a politician who knew how to use favorable circumstances. As the Venetians at that time ruled Krk, it was in their interest to place – a domestic man in the place of the prince, no matter how paradoxical. The reason for this was Venice's desire to make Krk as a station at the beginning of the waterway from the West to the East as suitable and peaceful as possible for tax collection and economic exploitation. The loan also built excellent relations with the second lever of power – Church. He strengthened spiritual discipline and interests by donating possessions to the Benedictines, but at the same time preserving the indigenous Croatian verb tradition. The loan was inherited by two sons from the first marriage of Vid I and Bartol I. Son from his second marriage Bartol II. he went from the island to the mainland and there placed himself in the service of the Croatian-Hungarian king Bele III. (1172.–1196). For merit, Bela III. he gave it before the very end of the 12th century to the county of Modruš on the administration. \n\nVinodol Code - Between Fortress Officers and New Masters − Krk, the Mondruš and vinodol princes − there were conflicts and quarrels. In order to determine in writing the rights and duties of the conflicting parties, a commission of 42 members met on January 6, 1288. Bijahu these representatives of nine wine-growing municipalities – New Town ( today New Vinodolski), Ledenica, Bribira, Grižana, Drivenika, Hreljina, Bakra, Trsat and Grobnik. Thus the Vinodol Code was created. Written during the reign of the Croatian-Hungarian king Andrew II. (1205.−1235.), The Vinodol Code is preserved in a transcript from the 16th century and is written in verb. The fact that this original and extensive document from the 13th century was composed in the vernacular classifies it as important Croatian cultural monuments. The first edition of the Vinodol Code was published by Antun Mažuranic in 1843. In legal terms, the Vinodol Code was not only a reflection of old customary rights, but was adapted to the needs of the then social order. It extensively elaborates criminal law with a system of punishments, benefits, the appearance of the court, and the mutual rights and obligations of peasants and princes. Some articles also enacted legal provisions on the rights of women, on their personal and moral protection. \n\nElizabeta Frankopan ( about 1386.−1422.) There is hardly a better example of the marital practice of the time than the story of the marriage of Elizabeth, daughter of Catherine Carrara and Stephen I. Frankopan. She was engaged as a two-year-old to Count Frederick II. Celjskog who was 24 years old at the time of his engagement! Choosing a member of the Celje family as his wife to his child was a real political-business venture, one could say an investment. The Counts of Celjski belonged among the most influential greats of the Hungarian and Croatian crowns, but also the neighboring Styria in the German Empire. Elizabeth's uncle Nicholas IV. Frankopan promised the Counts of Celje in the name of the dowry of Trsat, Bakar, Bribir and half of the island of Krk. It is not known when and where the marriage took place, but it is known that the scenes from Elizabeth’s married life were unfortunate. Her wife is Pope Pius II. described, most likely for political reasons, as a cruel, ruthless man adding that he was a unbeliever, insidious, a materialist, a simple carrot and imprisoned. Elizabeth gave birth to her son Ulrik II in Krško at the age of 19, and from 1414 to 1422 she lived separated from her husband. The attempt at reconciliation in Krapina for Elizabeth was fatal. The next morning, she was found dead stabbed in the chest with a hunting knife. Fridrik fled to Buda. The possible cause of the murder is related to the beautiful girl Veronica Desinićka, a noble genus but from a poor Kochev family. Fridrih married her in 1425. After Elizabeth's murder, the Frankopans took away all the possessions they had pledged to them as a dowry with difficulty. \n\nPod shield stars and lions Frankopans have used two coats of arms throughout history. By 1430 they had used an old man with a six-pointed star in a red field, and from that year they had taken over the coat of arms of the Roman patrician family de Frangepanibus with two lions breaking bread. The oldest coats of arms of the princes of Krk were recorded in stone form and were not dated. The first testimony was recorded in his travelogue by an anonymous Spanish friar who found himself in Senj in 1330, then under the administration of the Krk nobles. In the description of the flag of the city he cites two fields, in the upper red there is a golden six-pointed star, and below a silver field that is empty. The same combination of colors and the star's digit is found in the junction of the ribs of the monastery church in Košljun, which the Frankopans received from the pope for the Franciscans. Change of performance when Nicholas IV. In 1430, for a visit to the pope in Rome, he was given permission to use the coat of arms of the de Frangepanibus family. Alleged Roman relatives used as a sign two lions sharing bread, which in heraldry is also called the talking coat of arms, because the signs explain the meaning of the genus name: bread dividers. The new coat of arms did not suddenly displace the old six-pointed star, penetrating gradually, often appearing in combination with the old one. Already on the coats of arms of Nicholas' sons in the right corner is the old coat of arms, and in the left is the French: in the blue field, two upright lions share three golden loaves. Over time, the old coat of arms is increasingly neglected, and the new French coat of arms lasts until the family is extinguished in 1671. \n\nBarbara Frankopan ( unknown year of birth − 1504.) The daughter of Jelena of an unknown genus and Sigismund Frankopan, lord of the Islands, was married to Vuk Brankovic, the titular Serbian despot. Unlike Elizabeth, Barbara was lucky in love even though Vuka called Dragon Ognjen because of her calmness in the fight with the Turks. Barbara had no children with Vuk, but he took special care of her and showed her great tenderness and love. In case she outlived him, he wanted to materially secure her. Therefore, with the king's prior permission, he donated the fort to White Rock on the slopes of Mount Psunj with an area where there were more than a hundred villages. Despotica Barbara, as she was called for the life of her husband, outlived her husband. After his death, she continued to live at the court in White Rock, which was reportedly lavishly arranged. She later married the egg ban Franjo Berislavic Grabarsko. There is little information about their ten-year marriage, only that Barbara Frankopan, married to Berislavic, gave birth to a son, Ivan. Barbara's marriages clearly speak of the marriage strategies and life interests of the modern Frankopans as one of the most prominent Croatian and Slavonian greats. They were married, by no means accidental, to the leading bearers of the anti-Ottoman resistance on the southern borders of the Hungarian-Croatian kingdom. \n\nFranjo I. Frankopan Slunjski (1536.−1572.) Most of his property was in the immediate neighborhood of Bosnian Sandzak and exposed to constant Ottoman danger. He spent all his income from the estate on fortifying his cities and guards. Together with Janko Draskovic, he was a Croatian ban. It is the last of the mucous lineage of Frankopan. Son of George II. Slunjski and Ana Blagajski spent their entire non-navigable long life in the battles with the Ottomans. Thanks only to his courage and military skill, the Ottoman invaders did not achieve greater success for his lives. That great warrior who exposed his life to danger almost daily died, due to a slight but unprofessional medical procedure, in Varaždin. His death befell him on his way to Moravia to a wedding with his fiancée Julia, daughter of Ladislav Kereczenyi, a former Sigetic captain and one of the richest feudal lords in Hungary and Croatia. The death of a ban they called the sword and shield of the rest of Illyria resonated throughout the state. He was buried in the Zagreb table, where his sister Ana placed a plaque stating that Francis I was the prince of Senj, Krk and Modruš. His goods and valuables were taken over by the royal treasury. Immediately after Francis' death, the Ottoman governor Ferhat Pasha directed his attacks on his possessions. \n\nAna Katarina Frankopan ( about 1625.−1673.) Her father was Wolf II. Krsto Frankopan (1589.-1652.), commander of the Karlovac General. She was his daughter from another marriage. She married at the age of sixteen Peter Zrinsko (1621.−1671.), of whom she was an associate in economic and political affairs, especially at the time of the conspiracy. Ana Katarina participated in a secret diplomatic mission in mid-September 1664: Peter sent her to Venice to begin negotiations with a French envoy, to put the Zrinski family under the auspices of the most powerful European ruler Louis XIV. Negotiations did not lead to success, which did not shake Ana Katarina – she stayed with her husband until the end, tearing off all the consequences of the political crash. The day after the husbands and brothers went to Vienna (1670.), the army robbed Čakovec. In that poverty, she contracted a bony. After the execution of the death sentence, her husband and brother were transferred to the Dominican Sisters Monastery in Graz. Here the eclipsed mind died and was buried in the crypt of the monastery church. Catherine tried her life in the literary field, in a specific type of writing a spiritual text for a travel breviary or as it was then called – tovarush. In 1661, its Pocket Tovarush was printed in Venice. In the negotiation of Ana Katarina, in addition to spiritual reasons, she also explains the additional reason for writing and printing that book — because ... almost the seed of the Svit the linguist of the least Hervack this age of printed book editions... \n\nFran Krsto Frankopan ( about 1643.−1671.) Fran Krsto remained primarily remembered as a participant in the Urota of Zrin-Francopanska, for which he was punished by death in his 28th year of life and executed in 1671 in Vienna's New Town. Son of Wolf II. Krste and Ursule Inhofer, Fran Krsto, as an Ogulin captain, also wanted to get a senjska captaincy, which was prevented by the Austrian military administration. Encouraged by this and otherwise dissatisfied with the policy of the Viennese court, especially after the Peace of Yoursvar, he decided in 1669 to join the anti-Austrian conspiracy of the Croatian and Hungarian nobility led by Peter Zrinski. Not waiting for the promised Ottoman help and underestimating the Krajina forces, they raised the uprising with only 300 cavalry. Realizing soon that he was alone and betrayed by the Turks, Fran Krsto took refuge in Čakovec from where he and Zrinski went to Vienna to beg forgiveness from the emperor. In Vienna, both were arrested, detained separately and placed under investigation. Both were transferred to Vienna New Town Prison and charged with grandeur. In April 1671, they were sentenced to death by beheading, and all their estates were confiscated. His wife Julia Ana took refuge in Italy in April 1670, where she died as a nun in the Roman monastery of St. Theresa. \n\nNavik he lives ki zgine honestly Resistance to Vienna took place through two conspiracies. In the first conspiracy of the dissatisfied, he led Ban Nikola Zrinski in Croatia, and the palatine Ferenc Wesselényi in Hungary. The second, Urota Zrinsko-Francopanska, was led by Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan. The latter, although strongly mystified and mythologized in the Croatian tradition, was pre-convicted to ruin and completely unrealistic, especially when the conspirators turned to the Ottomans. In the first conspiracy, conspirators had to seek help outside the country: in France, Poland, and even in the Ottoman Empire. But despite promises, traditional Austrian opponents did not help them. Urota ended in the suspicious death of Nikola Zrinsko in the hunt for boars. She was mystified in a conspiracy theory in which the Viennese court is accused of Nikola's death. The second conspiracy was led by Nikola's brother Petar Zrinski, who, together with his Shurjac Fran Krst Frankopan, continued the fight and ties with the main Hungarian leaders. The Croatian-Hungarian alliance soon disintegrated, and negotiations to support the grooves were transferred from France to the Ottoman Empire. The skillfully prepared conspiracy was revealed just at the time Fran Krsto Frankopan began to prepare for an armed uprising, not knowing that the Ottomans would not support it. They were convicted of insulting the king and betraying the country to death by cutting off their right hand and head. They were executed on April 30, 1671. As a special grace, they were forgiven for the punishment of cutting off their hands. Before the execution of the two great men, as well as their families, they were deprived of the nobility, and all their estates were confiscated by the state. The execution caused outrage in Croatia, Hungary and Europe. The Banska chair remained vacant until 1680, when Nikola Erdödy, a Croatian great-religious man of Hungarian descent, was appointed to her as an exponent of the court and a longtime enemy of the Zrins. There was no more resistance to court absolutism and centralization of administration in Croatia. On the tomb of Fran Krst Frankopan and Peter Zrinsko in Zagreb Cathedral as an epitaph stands the verse of Fran Krsta Frankopan Navik he lives ki zgina honestly. \n\nIrac, the spiritual successor of Frankopan! The fascination with the Frankopans was great, and one of those who was particularly determined by the spiritual succession with the Croatian greats was Laval Nugent (1777.−1862.) Count, Field Marshal, Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, Commander of the Order of Maria Theresa and Prince of Rome. The story is more fascinating because Nugent was not from the Croatian region. He was born in Ballynacor, Ireland. As a member of the Austrian army for the Napoleonic Wars, he came to Rijeka in 1813. In Naples, Laval married Giovanna Riario-Sforza and that entry into the ancient Sforza family, which was in distant kinship ties with the Frankopans, marked Nugent's multiple passion for archeology, history and art. The connection with the Frankopans, perhaps only as part of a family legend, was crucial when he bought the old French city of Bosiljevo and the French-panel castle on Trsat, a hill above Rijeka. There he gave to build a chapel and tomb for his family members, as well as an ambitious museum of a rich collection that today makes funduses of the large Croatian museums in Zagreb and Rijeka.",
    "sadrzajIntpCentri":"First. Chabar Interpretation Center. In the 16th century, the Frankopans inherited Zrinski, who base the economy on the exploitation of natural resources. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Ottomans occupied a large number of Frankish estates in the Mountain District, and almost half of the population moved away. Stjepan Frankopan, the last male descendant of the Ozal branch, signed a contract with Nikola Šubić Zrinski, the husband of his sister Katarina, which passed the remaining heritage of the Frankopans of Ozaljski into the hands of the descendants of Nicholas and Catherine. Their great-grandchildren Nikola and Petar Zrinski, who participated in the Zrinsko-Francopan conspiracy with Fran Krst Frankopan, jointly managed most of their manors. The mountain district, together with Primorje, mostly entered the possession of the princes of Zrinski in the area of Banska Croatia, where it remained until the execution of Frankopan and Zrinski in 1671. \n\n2. Interpretation Center Ship to Buy. Zrinski continued on their way, and in particular improved the exploitation of forests, which they christened to maintain ore processing plants, the timber trade, and the creation of pastures. Both using the natural riches of the Mountain Cotar, they made numerous mistakes as they are still inherent in modern man today. Nature quickly told them where their borders were. To those who respected her, nature did well and revealed her healing sides. The Frankopan and Zrinski families knew the healing of the plants well, especially women stood out. Home pharmacies were well equipped with treatment utensils and numerous recipes, especially those made of herbs. The tips of the herbalists were extremely appreciated. Books with prescription drugs, herbarias, and books on plants could be found in libraries. At the same time, serfs, working in forests and hunting grounds, acquired the knowledge we call folk medicine today. \n\n3. Interpretation Center Tomb. The surrender says that the Tomb Field was named after the graves of Tatars and Croats, killed in the battle that allegedly took place there in 1242, but that story is kept unconfirmed due to lack of evidence. The southwest tower with the former chapel of St. Jelena on the ground floor is the oldest part harder, while the core of the castle with a triangle-shaped floor plan with towers at the corners originated from the 15th to the 17th century. The tomb had great defensive importance for the Frankopans. At the time of the Ottoman burglary, after the Battle of the Krbavsko Field in 1493, Bernardin Frankopan often resided in the Tomb. It is believed that in Kaštel Grobnik in the 16th century there was a scriptor from which, at the urging of Bernardin Frankopan, the first Bible in Croatian language, which has not been preserved. But the Second Novljan Breviary has been preserved - a prayer code written for most of the 500 leaves by the pop Martinac. Pop Martinac was the chief scribe, illuminator and calligrapher of the tomb script, and this record is an exceptional work written by a man of strong feelings and great literary culture in which the beginnings of Croatian patriotic poetry are recognized because it was the events related to the Krbava battle that shook its surroundings and him. Find out more about the topic of Ottoman incursions and political turmoil in the French era by coming to this Interpretation Center! \n\n4. Trsat Interpretation Center. There is no area of the French state in which their close connection with the Church is not seen: various documents confirmed the monks' donated goods, assigned them new estates. The Frankopan patronage enjoyed several church orders, two of which had a special place – Franciscans and Paulines. The monks prayed for donors for the forgiveness of sins and the salvation of the souls of the deceased, but there are also important secular reasons for the Frankish patronage. The support of the Church brought political points, she used the donated resources moderately and contributed to economic development. Through the control of church institutions, the Frankopans also consolidated secular power. Family members often expressed their faith in very personal and intimate endowments. \n\n5. Copper Interpretation Center. The steep caravan routes leading from the Mountain Cotar to Bakr were merchant highways to which the goods traveled through the Frankish territory. In the 16th century, Bakar received great privileges and was the seat of the governor of the Frankish cities of Hreljin, Drivenik, Bribir and Grobnik. Petar Zrinski gave the trade and the port complete freedom with slight burdens, which resulted in Bakar being the port with the strongest traffic in the entire Croatian coast. The volume of the store is evidenced by the fact that the copper warehouses were crowded, so even some church chapels were turned into magazines. \n\n6. Kraljevica Interpretation Center. Zrinski and Frankopani were the two most powerful large families in Croatia in the 17th century, and they built their wealth and power for centuries, which is why they often came into conflict with imperial rule. Yet, until the fatal Urota, they held the highest military and secular duties in the country. However, the development of historical events, unfortunate circumstances, and erroneous political assessments resulted in a failed action against the Habsburgs that tragically ended up as major conspirators. Leaders were executed, their possessions were dismantled, and heirs deprived of the opportunity to ever regain their former positions and power. The narrative of the life, heroism and tragic death of the last Zrinski and Frankopan became the backbone of the most famous national cult in the Croats. An important topos in the emergence of this cult is certainly Nova Kraljevica, a castle built as a lavish residence at the entrance to the Bay of Bakar in 1654 by Petar Zrinski and his wife Ana Katarina Frankopan. The surrender says that in 1669, in the court chapel, in front of the statue of the Mother of God, Count Peter of Zrinski and the Marquis Fran Krsto Frankopan conspired „ to free the homeland from strangers...“, therefore it is believed that the place of minting Urota is precisely the castle of Nova Kraljevica. \n\n7. Bribir Interpretation Center. It is home to the nine wine-growing municipalities: Novi, Ledenice, Bribir, Grižane, Drivenik, Hreljin, Bakar, Trsat, The tomb is chosen by representatives who, in order to protect their rights, not only write down popular legal customs but reflect on them in the new circumstances of feudalism. In promoting the spirit of justice, the code is still current and instructive. He is not only a dictate of the ruling class subordinated, but an example of a social contract. Although the grant is of the Hungarian-Croatian King Andrew II. Vinodol in 1225 fell under the rule of the Krk manor, the free peasants did not want to become serfs, so the code is the real art of compromise. On the one hand, the Vinodolians recognize the authority of the island princes, but these at the same time make concessions to them. The penalties arising from the provisions of the Vinodol Code are mostly monetary, which also speaks to the degree of economic development of the then society, as well as from the absence of evidence of the so-called of the court of God and torture, which the law itself makes in its time and environment very advanced. The Code recognizes the current danger of corruption of public officials and presents a number of provisions that limit their arbitrariness. The special value of the Vinodol Code is the attention it pays to women, their personal, moral protection and integrity. \n\n8. Krk Interpretation Center. From the 12th to the 15th century, the Frankopans built a castle on Krk, intended for it with a defensive function and the possibility of harmonizing the regiment during the attack. The construction of the fort is layered, and as a foundation it takes the remains of the earlier, Roman and late antique, phases of the city. The square tower, the oldest part of the castle, was originally a cathedral bell tower, later a courtroom. Latin inscription on the lunette installed on top of the entrance door of the tower in the second half of the 12th century and conversion and confirmation. It is pointed out that this is a joint venture of the whole municipality during the time of the Bishop of Krk Ivan and the Krk princes Bartol I and Vida I.",
    "sadrzajKPU":"The culture and art of the Frankopans were associated with the Christian faith and feudal social structure. They built many churches and monasteries, often built in the Gothic style, which were important cultural and spiritual centers. Some of the most important architectural projects of the Frankopans were the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in Šibenik, Church of St. John the Baptist in Nin and the Church of St. Mary in Vrpolje. These churches are important works of art that testify to the architectural and artistic excellence of the time. The Francophones also supported the mecen arts, resulting in the emergence of many valuable works of art. \n\nRelics and statues were an important part of their art, as were the frescoes that covered the walls of the church and the monastery. These artwork often depicted religious themes and depicted saints and characters from the Bible. The Francophones were also known for their literature and language. Their language was Croatian, but it contained many elements of Latin, Italian and other languages. Their literature included poetry, prose, and drama, and many of their works were religious or mythological. In the culture and art of Frankopan, their influences on the culture and art of the Croatian people are visible, and their contribution to the architectural, artistic and literary world.",
    "piktogrami":"Frankopans were a Croatian noble family from the region of Dalmatia. They used a variety of symbols and coats of arms throughout their history. Some of the more notable symbols associated with the Frankopans include the Frankopan coat of arms, which features three golden lions on a red field, and the Frankopan flag, which features a red field with a white cross. Additionally, the Frankopans also used the symbol of St. Nicholas, who is the patron saint of the family. \n\nAnother symbol associated with the Frankopans is the checkered design, which is often incorporated into their coat of arms and flags. This symbol is believed to represent the family's origins in the region of Dalmatia, where checkerboard patterns were common in traditional folk art and architecture. Another symbol that is closely associated with the Frankopans is the fleur-de-lis, which is often found in their coat of arms and flags. This symbol is believed to represent the family's French origins and their connection to the French royal family. Additionally, the Frankopans also used the symbol of the eagle. The eagle is a symbol of power, authority and strength, which is appropriate for a noble family. The eagle can be found in their coat of arms and flags. \n\nThe Frankopans also used the symbol of the crown, which represents their noble status and prestige. The crown can be found in their coat of arms and flags, which is a representation of the family's power and influence. In general, the Frankopans used a variety of symbols in their heraldry and iconography, which reflect their history, origin, and prestige.",
